# Hey, I'm Ryan! 👋
I'm a Computer Science major + Interaction Design minor at Northeastern University. I'm a web developer at heart, but I have a soft spot for all things functional and fun. I usually spend a lot of my time playing with new technologies, reading blog posts, or coding something fun and useful. I feel most meaningful and excited when I'm creating a product that could help people I care about. ❤

When I'm not coding, I'm probably losing in [StarCraft II](https://starcraft2.com/en-us/profile/1/1/9860436/summary) 👾 or listening to some ~~objectively bad music~~ [funky soft bops](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0CFlqBuh07772e416382LP?si=wWgpbDQ1T_Ki7mSWLEsh6g). 🎧


## What I'm working on

I do a lot of work for [Code4Community](https://c4cneu.com), a club at Norteastern that develops software solutions for non-profts here in Boston. I work as a frontend developer and amateur designer.

I'm also working on developing [Code Sync, a DrRacket plugin to share code](https://github.com/rymaju/code-sync). I'm planning to get it up and running before September 9th for students in the fall.
